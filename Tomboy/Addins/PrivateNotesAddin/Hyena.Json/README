About Hyena.Json in Tomboy
--------------------------
Banshee uses a different C# style guideline than Tomboy does.
Please follow the Banshee guidelines when working in Hyena.Json,
to make upstream collaboration more efficient.

So far, the only additions Tomboy has made to Hyena.Json are
Hyena.Json.Serializer and its associated unit tests, and specific
support for integers in the Tokenizer and Deserializer.
